Then, the volume of the cube is:\n\nV = s³ = 1,000 cubic centimeters\n\nNow, if each side of the cube is doubled in length, the new side length becomes 2s.\n\nThe new volume of the cube will be:\n\nV_new = (2s)³ = 2³s³ = 8s³\n\nSince the initial volume was 1,000 cubic centimeters, we know that s³ = 1,000.
