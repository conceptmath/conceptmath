We can count the number of ways this can happen by counting the number of ways each of the three equations can happen and adding them together.\n\nLet's count the number of ways $A+B=C$ can happen.

The volumes of the two cylinders are related by a scaling factor of 1/8, since the new cylinder's volume is one-eighth the volume of the original cylinder.\n2. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n3. Since the cylinders are similar, their radii are proportional to each other. Let's call the radius of the new cylinder \"r\" and the radius of the original cylinder \"R\". Then, we can write: R = kr, where k is the scaling factor.\n4.
